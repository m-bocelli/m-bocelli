# *Michael Bocelli*
Hello ðŸ‘‹ . I am a **computer science** and **international relations** major, driven to pursue a career primarily in game development. As the most prominent medium of my youth, I hope to create projects in which future generations can forge memories around - just as I have.

So far, I have completed studying the fundamentals of computer science in **Python**, and currently I am studying **Java** and systems programming with **C**.

I also have minor experience in the Unity game engine using C++, however, most of this experience is related to 3D modelling and environment creation (a hobby of mine developed out of school). Therefore, I am also familiar with the Blender software.
