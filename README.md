# *Michael Bocelli*
I am a **computer science** and **international relations** major, driven to pursue a career in programming.

So far, I have completed studying the fundamentals of computer science in **Python**, and currently I am studying **Java** and systems programming with **C**.

I also have minor experience in the Unity game engine using C++, however, most of this experience is related to 3D modelling and environment creation (a hobby of mine developed out of school). Therefore, I am also familiar with the Blender software.

You can contact me at michael.j.bocelli@gmail.com if you want to work together, or check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-bocelli/) to connect.
