# *Michael Bocelli*
I am a **computer science** and **international relations** major at the University of Delaware. Although I am relatively new to the computer science field, I have become driven to pursue a career in programming. I enjoy balancing my affinity for the creative with my skills in the technical, so my eventual goal is work in software development and/or game design.
________

So far, I have completed studying the fundamentals of computer science in **Python**, and currently I am studying **Java** and systems programming with **C**. 

I also have minor experience in the Unity game engine using C++, however, most of this experience is related to 3D modelling and environment creation (a hobby of mine developed out of school). Therefore, I am also familiar with the **Blender** software.

Further hobbies of mine include learning more about the world (hence international relations) and studying languages (right now I have 7 years of German experience ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª).
