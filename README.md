# *Michael Bocelli*
Hello ðŸ‘‹ . I am a **computer science** and **international relations** major looking to pursue a career primarily in game development.

So far, I have completed studying the fundamentals of computer science through a class in Python at the **University of Delaware**, and currently I am
studying Java and systems programming with C.

I also have minor experience in the Unity game engine using C++, however, most of this experience is related to 3D modelling and environment creation (a hobby of mine developed out of school). Therefore, I am also familiar with the Blender software.
